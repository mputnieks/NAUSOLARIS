# NAUSOLARIS
Open-sourced files from a year of developing the INfiniti CubeSat prototype, part of the NAUSOLARIS programme. Includes blog posts, descriptions, code, PCB gerber files as well as lasercutting files for structure. Have fun!

In case questions arise, don't hesitate to reach out!

We are excited to see what you can built upon the foundation we have laid, any modules designed etc., let us know of your projects!
